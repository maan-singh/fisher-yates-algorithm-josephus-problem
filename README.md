## _ Shuffle Songs & Fisher Yates Algorithm _

An aggregation of two separate projects, one that 
uses an algorithm to shuffle 'songs in a playlist' (Playlist & PlaylistTester) and other project, that uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to solve the famous Josephus problem (CircularLinkedList, CircularLinkedListTester, Node). 
PS- Both projects are supported with JUnit tests found in the corresponding tester classes.
