## Fisher-Yates Algorithm & Josephus Problem

An aggregation of two separate projects, one that 
uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle 'songs in a playlist' (Playlist & PlaylistTester) and other project, that solves the famous Josephus problem (CircularLinkedList, CircularLinkedListTester, Node) using a self-written algorithm by implementing circular linked lists. 
PS- Both projects are supported with JUnit tests found in the corresponding tester classes.
